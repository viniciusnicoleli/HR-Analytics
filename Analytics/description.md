# Studying Python and People Analytics area.

The main idea here is to train and gain the most experience for the upcoming analysis.

I'm beggining with an EDA analysis, which will embrace the need for a analysis in detail.

Mains:

- Predict Attrition (Class)
- Predict Monthly Rate (Regression)

Questions for Attrition:

* Gotta check the Distribution of each feature, and classes, to understand how they seem to work.

* Test with scatterplots if the Attrition looks to have any relation with the Years in a company.

    - YearsAtCompany
    - YearsInCurrentRole
    - YearsSinceLastPromotion
    - YearsWithCurrManager
    - WorkLifeBalance
    - TotalWorkingYears

* Test Job Satisfaction in the same way as Attrition.
